# Connect 4 Game

This is a simple implementation of the Connect 4 game using React.

## Rules of the Game
Connect Four is a two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping one colored disc from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next available space within the column. The objective of the game is to connect four of one's own discs of the same color next to each other vertically, horizontally, or diagonally before your opponent.

## Features

- A winner modal appears when a player has won the game.
