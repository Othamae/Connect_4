## Rules of the Game
Connect Four is a two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping one colored disc from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next available space within the column. The objective of the game is to connect four of one's own discs of the same color next to each other vertically, horizontally, or diagonally before your opponent.

## Features
- Players can reset the game at any time by clicking the "Reset Game" button.
- The game ends when a player has connected four of their pieces or when the board is full, resulting in a tie.
- A winner modal appears when a player has won the game.
- The turn indicator shows which player's turn it is.
- The game board is fully responsive and can be played on any device.
